## Solution components

![alt text](./images/solution-components.png "Solution components diagram")

We have 1 (mock) 3rd-party `Voucher Service`, which doesn't have any database.
2 other services, `Prepaid Data Service` (for purchasing, applying and querying vouchers ) and `Account Service` to hold information of a phone number.

`Prepaid Data Service` will call to `Account Service` to verify the phone number.

Business flow:
- User complete payment to get the Data package that they want (1GB, 2GB, ...)
- User now can get a Voucher corresponding to the Data package they've just bought.
- After purchasing a Voucher, user can use it immediately, or share it with other people.
- To view purchased Vouchers, user first need to do authentication, this can be done by OTP.
- After authentication, user now can view their purchased Vouchers.


NOTE: Although the image only includes arrows from the API Gateway to `Prepaid Data Service` and `Account Service`, you still can call directly to other services via the API Gateway.

## Frameworks, tools, libraries

In addition to the solution components, this is a list of all framework and libraries that are used in this project:

### Spring dependencies
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud API Gateway (can be changed to Zuul)
- Spring Cloud Starter Netflix Eureka (Server, Client)
- Spring Boot Starter Test (including JUnit 5)
- Spring Boot Starter AOP (join point to secure a controller)
- Spring Boot Starter OpenFeign (calling API like a Java method)
- Spring Boot Starter Data JPA 
- Spring Boot Starter Web


### Other Java Dependencies
- Model Mapper (mapping different object types)
- Java Faker (generate testing data)
- PostgreSQL (connect to Postgre DB)
- Rest Assured (testing controller method)
- Lombok (no more boilerplate code)
- H2 (self-contained testing)


## Entities relationship

![alt text](./images/database-diagram.png "Entity relationship diagram")

The system is designed in such a way that a voucher can be shared between any phone numbers or accounts (as long as it hasn't been applied).

## Project structure

### Entire project

- **account-service**: account micro service
- **api-gateway**: the api gateway
- **databases**: it has only one `database.yaml` file, you can use this file to spin up 2 Postgre DB for `Account Service` and `Prepaid Data Service`.
- **images**: contains images that are used in this README.md file
- **prepaid-data-service**: prepaid data micro service, including end points for purchasing, applying/sharing and viewing vouchers.

### Spring Boot project with Feign

![alt text](./images/project-structure.jpg "Project structure")

All of the Spring Boot projects follow this structure.

- **client**: classes of http client, Feign client in this case
- **configuration**: `@Configuration` classes
- **controller**: `@RestController` classes
- **dto**: model returned by the controller
- **entity**: `@Entity` classes
- **exception**: custom exception classes, `@ControllerAdvice` handle all exceptions before returning DTO to the user
- **model**: controller request models
- **repositroy**: `@JpaRepository` interfaces
- **security**: security related classes, in this project it contains code to generate, verify JWT token, and a custom `@SecuredEndPoint` annotation to secure the API to get vouchers.
- **service**: service interfaces and implementation classes
- **utility**: other classes
- `{project-name}Application.java`, Spring Boot generated classes, to start the Spring Boot application.
- **resources**: contains resources of project, static files, templates, `properties` or `yaml` files, ...
- **test**: code for testing, in this cases they are self-contained integration test.
- **target**: can be ignored, generated when we run `mvn clean installed`
- `mvnw`, `HELP.md`, `mvnw.cmd`, `*.iml` are Intellij files and can be ignored. 

The diagram below describes what kind of data is transferred back and forth between layers in a Spring Boot project:

```

- Maven installed, be able to download dependencies listed in the `pom.xml` files in the projects.

> mvn -v
```
Maven home: /opt/apache-maven-3.6.3
Java version: 1.8.0_275, vendor: Amazon.com Inc., runtime: /home/lov-truong/.sdkman/candidates/java/8.0.275-amzn/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "5.8.0-33-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "un
```

- Make sure you can run `mvn` and `docker-compose` commands (on Windows you might need to check the path variable of `$MVN_HOME` and `$JAVA_HOME`).

### Steps
Assuming you are currently in the project folder

1) Starting up the databases
```
cd databases
docker-compose -f database.yaml up
```

2) Starting up the Eureka service registry server
```
cd service-discovery
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -X
```

3) Starting up 3rd-party voucher service
```
cd voucher-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -X
```

4) Starting up Account service
```
cd account-service
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -X
```

5) Starting up Prepaid Data service
```
cd prepaid-data-service
mvn clean install
### 3rd-party Voucher Service

mvn spring-boot:run -X
```

6) Starting up API Gateway
```
cd api-gateway
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -X
```

NOTE:
- *Please make sure that `mvn clean install` is successful*
- Each step can be in one tab in Terminal

## CURLs
In this project, URLs of Eureka service registry server and the API Gateway are hardcoded.

- Eureka: http://localhost:8761
- Api Gateway: http://localhost:8760 (use this URL to access Eureka Dashboard)

Ports of `account-database` and `prepaid-database` are also hard coded as 5432 and 5431, respectively.

NOTE:
- **Please replace the ports if they are already in used**.
- For the API get vouchers, please read `Important Notes`.
- We are calling the URL endpoints via the API Gateway.

## Run Tests
- For testing, simply go in to each Spring Boot project (account service, prepaid data service, voucher service) and run `mvn test`

## Troubleshoot
- Please contact me directly or add an issue.

## Important Notes
- As of now, the `secret key` to generate JWT token is created and stored in `Prepaid data service`, every instance of that service will have it own `secret key`. The key need to be global for all instances of `Prepaid data service` to use. Such a need can be fulfilled by a Global Spring Cloud config server.
